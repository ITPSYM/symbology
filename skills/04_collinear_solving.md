# Skill 04 — Collinear constraint solver

## Purpose

A general collinear-like constraint solver. It solves `c · A = boundary`
for any projection that is structurally similar to the collinear
projection (i.e. one that produces an expanded basis `A` and a boundary
of matching shape):

- `A` is the expanded SEW collinear basis (rank `2L+1`:
  `{sew_dim, 11, ..., 11}`).
- `boundary` is the expected collinear limit at loop order `L` (rank
  `2L`: `{11, ..., 11}`).
- `c` is the unknown coefficient vector (length `sew_dim`).

**The letter-space projection used in the last step is user-selectable
via `--letter-projection`, and this choice is important.** The flag is
required — it is not hardcoded. Pass either:

- a path to a projection matrix (e.g.
  `output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf`), which is applied to each
  11-dim letter slot of both `A` and the boundary via
  `apply_colprojdiv_slots` before matching; or
- the literal `identity`, which means "do nothing" — the solve runs
  in the full 11-dim letter space with no projection applied.

`identity` is the do-nothing value: no projection is applied, and the
constraint `c·A = boundary` is enforced exactly in the full 11-dim
letter space (union matching). For the standard `E6` collinear solve
this is **inconsistent at all `L ≥ 2`** because the boundary `E1^L/L!`
has entries at letter combinations involving the divergent letters
`{0, 1}` that the SEW collinear basis `A` does not cover. Use
`colprojdiv_w1` to project both sides to the divergent subspace, where
their supports coincide exactly and `c·A` cancels `boundary` exactly.

The finite part is `R* = c·A - boundary`, which must be divergent-free
when a divergent projection is used (verified by the indicator-vector
method, skipped for `identity`).

## CLI entry point

```bash
./bootstrap --solve-collinear --target <SEW_FpL> --rhs <rhs.wxf|0> \
    --projection <finite|divergent> --letter-projection <file|identity> \
    [--basis <basis.wxf> ...] [--data-dir <dir>] [--output-dir <dir>]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--solve-collinear` | Run the collinear solver. |
| `--target <SEW_FpL>` | Target SEW name (e.g. `SEW_3p1` for 2-loop, `SEW_5p1` for 3-loop). |
| `--rhs <rhs.wxf>` or `--rhs 0` | RHS path. Required — exits with code 1 if missing. `--rhs 0` means an all-zero RHS constructed in-memory. |
| `--projection <finite\|divergent>` | Which projection to apply. Required — no default. |
| `--letter-projection <file\|identity>` | Letter-slot projection matrix. Required (no default — user-selectable). A path (e.g. `output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf`) projects each 11-dim letter slot to a lower-dim subspace; `identity` is the do-nothing value (solve in full letter space). Relative paths resolve against the executable directory. |
| `--basis <basis.wxf>` | Expansion basis file (repeatable; highest weight first). If omitted, auto-detected as `first_w{N}_basis.wxf` for weights `target_weight-1` down to 2. |
| `--data-dir <dir>` | Data directory with seed files (default: `<exec_dir>/data`). Resolved against the executable directory. |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | Output directory (default: `<exec_dir>/output`). Same resolution as `--data-dir`. |

## How it works

1. **Collinear projection chain** (`solve_collinear.hpp`):
   - Copy `data/colprojdiv.wxf` → `output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf`
     (and `colprojfin_w1.wxf`).
   - Recursively compute `colprojdiv_w{N}.wxf` and `colprojfin_w{N}.wxf`
     for `N = 2..F` by contracting the weight-`N-1` projection with the
     FEC weight-`N` basis.
   - Compute the SEW-level projection `colprojdiv_<sew_name>.wxf` (e.g.
     `colprojdiv_SEW_5p1.wxf`).

2. **Expand the SEW collinear basis** (`tensor_expand.hpp`):
   - Load `output/collinear/SEW_<name>_basis.wxf` (shape
     `{sew_dim, FEC_F_basis, 11}`).
   - Contract axis 1 with each `first_w{N}_basis.wxf` (highest weight
     first, down to weight 2).
   - Result: `A` with rank `2L+1`, dims `{sew_dim, 11, ..., 11}`.

3. **Project to the user-selected letter subspace** (`apply_colprojdiv_slots`):
   - The projection is **chosen by the user** via `--letter-projection`;
     it is not hardcoded. This makes the solver reusable for any
     collinear-like projection, not just the `E6` divergent one.
   - Apply the `--letter-projection` matrix to each 11-dim letter slot of
     both `A` and the boundary. The standard `E6` example is
     `colprojdiv_w1`, which projects to the 2-dim divergent subspace.
   - `A_proj` becomes `{sew_dim, 2, ..., 2}`; `boundary_proj` becomes
     `{2, ..., 2}`.
   - If `--letter-projection identity`, this step is **skipped** — the
     solve happens in the full 11-dim letter space ("do nothing").
   - A divergent projection is **required at `L ≥ 2`** for the `E6`
     example, because `E1` has divergent-letter entries
     (`E1[0,0] = -2`, `E1[1,1] = -2`) and the boundary `E1^L/L!`
     therefore has divergent components. Under union matching,
     `identity` is inconsistent at **all** `L ≥ 2` for `E6` because
     the boundary's entries at letter combinations involving `{0, 1}`
     are not covered by A in the full 11-dim space. Use
     `colprojdiv_w1` to project both sides to the divergent subspace,
     where the supports coincide exactly.

4. **Match positions — UNION of supports** (`A_match`, `b_match`):
   - Enforce `c·A = boundary` at **every** position where either `A` or
     `boundary` is nonzero (not just the intersection). This is the
     "exact match" semantics: after projecting both sides via
     `--letter-projection`, the projected supports should coincide and
     `c·A` cancels `boundary` exactly in the projected subspace.
   - Three cases per letter multi-index `key`:
     - **Both nonzero** (intersection): `c·A[key] = b[key]`.
     - **A nonzero, b zero** (homogeneous): `c·A[key] = 0` — enforces
       that A's extra support is annihilated by `c`.
     - **A zero, b nonzero** (b-only): `0 = b[key]` — trivially
       inconsistent. Detected before the linear solver; if any such
       position exists, the system is reported inconsistent and the
       solver is skipped.
   - Iterate `A_proj` directly (do **not** collapse into
     `std::map<key, T>` — that overwrites duplicate sew entries and
     breaks the multi-unknown system).
   - Preserve the sew axis in `A_match` so positions with both sew
     entries contribute two coefficients: `c0·A[0,key] + c1·A[1,key] = b[key]`.
   - When a divergent projection is used (`colprojdiv_w1`), the
     projected supports coincide exactly: intersection = union, with
     zero homogeneous and zero b-only positions. When `identity` is
     used, the boundary's finite components are not covered by A, so
     b-only positions appear and the system is inconsistent.

5. **Linear solve** (`linear_solve.hpp`):
   - Reshape `A_match` to `(n_unknowns, n_constraints)` and `b_match` to
     `(1, n_constraints)`.
   - Homogeneous constraints (A≠0, b=0) are included automatically:
     the solver collects "non-trivial" rows (where the A row has
     nonzero entries) and treats missing b entries as 0.
   - If too many constraints, sample `3 × n_unknowns` constraints, solve,
     then verify against all.
   - Uses modular RREF over `Z / 2^61` with reconstruction to `rat_t`.

6. **Indicator-vector verification** (skipped if `--letter-projection identity`):
   - Compute `R* = c·A - boundary` (in the **unprojected** full letter
     space — this is the finite remainder).
   - Collect the distinct letter indices appearing in `R*`'s non-zero
     entries.
   - Build an 11-dim indicator vector (1 at those indices, 0 elsewhere).
   - Project with the `--letter-projection` matrix. If the result is
     zero, `R*` is divergent-free (no entries at letters `{0, 1}`), so
     the collinear constraint is satisfied and `R*` is purely finite.

## Inputs

- `data/colprojdiv.wxf`, `data/colprojfin.wxf` (weight-1 seeds).
- `output/collinear/SEW_<name>_basis.wxf` (from `--project --symmetry collinear`).
- `output/collinear/first_w{N}_basis.wxf` (from the projection chain).
- The RHS file (passed via `--rhs`).

## Outputs

### To `output/collinear/`

|------|-------------|
| `colprojfin_w1.wxf`, `colprojdiv_w1.wxf` | Copies of the `data/` seeds (skipped if present) |

| `colprojfin_<sew_name>.wxf`, `colprojdiv_<sew_name>.wxf` | SEW-level projections (e.g. `colprojdiv_SEW_5p1.wxf`) |

Empty projections (0 rows) are not written.

### To `output/<L>loop/` (SEW targets only)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `solMHV_LL.wxf` | Solution coefficient vector `(1 × n_unknowns)`, written only if the system is consistent. `L = target_weight / 2`. |

## Key files

- `solve_collinear.hpp` — `run_collinear_proj_chain`,
  `run_collinear_solver`, `apply_colprojdiv_slots`, `detect_chain_base_paths`.
- `linear_solve.hpp` — `solve_linear_system` (modular RREF + reconstruct).
- `tensor_expand.hpp` — `expand_tensor` (contracts with a basis chain).

## Conventions

- **`--rhs` is required.** Missing `--rhs` → exit code 1 with a helpful
  message. `--rhs 0` means an empty (all-zero) RHS tensor.
- **`--projection` is required** — there is no default. Pass either
  `finite` or `divergent` explicitly.
- **`--letter-projection` is required** — there is no default. Pass
  either a file path (e.g. `output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf`) or
  the literal `identity` to skip projection (solve in full letter
  space). `identity` is the **do-nothing** value: no projection is
  applied. This makes the solver reusable for any collinear-like
  projection — the user selects the letter subspace to project into,
  instead of the code hardcoding `colprojdiv_w1`. Note: under union
  matching, `identity` requires `c·A` to match `boundary` exactly in
  the full letter space, which is a **stronger** constraint than the
  projected solve — for the `E6` example it is inconsistent at all
  `L ≥ 2` because the boundary has entries at letter combinations
  that A does not cover.
- **`--data-dir` / `--output-dir`**: default to `<exec_dir>/data` and
  `<exec_dir>/output`. Relative paths resolve against the executable
  directory (same convention as `bootstrap`).
- **SEW-level naming**: `colprojdiv_<sew_name>.wxf` where `sew_name`
  already includes the `SEW_` prefix (e.g.
  `colprojdiv_SEW_5p1.wxf`). The old name `colprojdiv_w6.wxf` was
  renamed to this.
- **Slot order**: must remain in natural ascending weight order
  `[w1, w2, w3, w4]`. The `expansion_perm` function places new letters
  immediately after the FEC axis to maintain this; placing them at the
  end reverses to `[w1, w4, w3, w2]` and breaks verification.
- **`colprojdiv_w1` swaps** the two divergent letters: for `E6`,
  `colprojdiv[0,1] = colprojdiv[1,0] = 1`. Do not assume it is a
  projection onto the first coordinate.
- **Every run generates a log file** in `logs/` recording tensor
  dimensions and file CRC32.

## Smoke test

```bash
# L=2: solve for c such that c·A = E1²/2 (the boundary)
./bootstrap --solve-collinear --target SEW_3p1 --rhs output/2loop/boundary_2L.wxf \
    --projection divergent --letter-projection output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf

# L=3: boundary = E1³/6 + E1·R2 (requires L=2 outputs to exist)
./bootstrap --solve-collinear --target SEW_5p1 --rhs output/3loop/boundary_3L.wxf \
    --projection divergent --letter-projection output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf
```

For the full recursive workflow (computing the boundary too), use
`compute_rhs` instead — see [05_compute_rhs.md](05_compute_rhs.md).
`compute_rhs` internally invokes `--solve-collinear` for each loop order.

## Verified status

- **L=2 (`SEW_3p1`)** with `colprojdiv_w1`: union matching reports
  8 intersection, 0 homogeneous, 0 b-only; unique solution `c[0] = 8`,
  all 8 constraints verified. `R2` is divergent-free.
- **L=3 (`SEW_5p1`)** with `colprojdiv_w1`: union matching reports
  32 intersection, 0 homogeneous, 0 b-only; unique solution
  `c[0] = -24, c[1] = 2`, all 32 constraints verified. `R3` contains
  only letters `{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}` (no divergent letters `{0,1}`),
  so `R3 = R*` is divergent-free.
- **`identity` at L=2**: union matching reports 44 intersection,
  87 homogeneous, 24 b-only → system is **inconsistent** (24 positions
  where `boundary ≠ 0` but `A = 0`). This is expected: the boundary
  `E1²/2` has divergent-letter entries that A does not cover in the
  full 11-dim space.
- **`identity` at L=3**: union matching reports 4037 intersection,
  7569 homogeneous, 1857 b-only → system is **inconsistent** (1857
  b-only positions).

## Pitfalls

1. **Map overwrite bug**: never collapse `A` into `std::map<key, T>`
   when `sew_dim > 1`. Iterate `A` directly and preserve the sew axis.
2. **Union matching requires exact cancellation**: the constraint
   `c·A = boundary` is enforced at the **union** of A's and boundary's
   supports. Positions where `boundary ≠ 0` but `A = 0` make the system
   trivially inconsistent (0 = nonzero). For the `E6` example, this
   means `--letter-projection identity` is inconsistent at all `L ≥ 2`
   — use a divergent projection (`colprojdiv_w1`) so both sides are
   projected to a subspace where their supports coincide.
3. **`expansion_perm` slot order**: new letters go immediately after
   the FEC axis, not at the end.
