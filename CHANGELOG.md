## [2026-07-04] Union matching for collinear constraint (--letter-projection)

### Summary
Changed the collinear constraint matching from **intersection-only**
(enforce `c·A = boundary` only at positions where both are nonzero) to
**union** (enforce at every position where either is nonzero). This is
the "exact match" semantics: after projecting both sides via
`--letter-projection`, the projected supports should coincide and
`c·A` cancels `boundary` exactly in the projected subspace. Under
union matching:

- Positions where `A ≠ 0` but `boundary = 0` become **homogeneous**
  constraints `c·A[key] = 0` (enforced automatically by the linear
  solver, which treats missing b entries as 0).
- Positions where `boundary ≠ 0` but `A = 0` make the system
  **trivially inconsistent** (0 = nonzero). These are detected before
  the linear solver and reported with a count.

Consequence: `--letter-projection identity` is now **inconsistent at
all `L ≥ 2`** for the `E6` example, because the boundary `E1^L / L!`
has entries at letter combinations involving the divergent letters
`{0, 1}` that the SEW collinear basis `A` does not cover in the full
11-dim space. Previously (intersection matching) `identity` appeared
to work at `L = 2`; this was incorrect — the divergent entries were
silently skipped. With a divergent projection (`colprojdiv_w1`) the
supports coincide exactly (0 homogeneous, 0 b-only) and the verified
solutions `c[0] = 8` (L=2) and `c[0] = -24, c[1] = 2` (L=3) are
preserved.

### Modified
- **`solve_collinear.hpp`** (`run_collinear_solver`) — replaced the
  intersection-only matching loop with a two-pass union matcher: (1)
  iterate A, emit every A entry paired with `b[key]` if present else
  with 0 (homogeneous); (2) scan b_map for keys not in A_keys and
  count b-only positions. If any b-only position exists, set
  `result.consistent = false` and skip the linear solver. Added
  logging of the three categories (intersection / homogeneous /
  b-only).
- **Docs** (`skills/04`, `skills/05`, `skills/README`, `README`,
  `CHANGELOG`) — updated Step 5 (matching), Conventions, Smoke test,
  Verified status, and Pitfalls to reflect union matching. Removed
  the misleading "identity works at L=2" claim (it was an artifact of
  intersection matching). All examples now use `colprojdiv_w1`.

### Behavior change
Previously, `--letter-projection identity` at `L = 2` returned a
"consistent" solution `c[0] = 8` because the solver only enforced
constraints at the intersection of A's and boundary's supports. Under
union matching, the same invocation now correctly reports
**inconsistent** (24 b-only positions at L=2; 1857 at L=3). This is
the intended behavior per the design spec: `identity` is the
do-nothing value, but "do nothing" means "require exact cancellation
in the full letter space", which is a stronger constraint than the
projected solve.

### Verification
- `colprojdiv_w1` at L=2: union matching 8 intersection / 0
  homogeneous / 0 b-only → unique solution `c[0] = 8`, 8 constraints
  verified. `R2` divergent-free. (Unchanged from before.)
- `colprojdiv_w1` at L=3: union matching 32 intersection / 0
  homogeneous / 0 b-only → unique solution `c[0] = -24, c[1] = 2`,
  32 constraints verified. `R3` divergent-free. (Unchanged from
  before.)
- `identity` at L=2: union matching 44 intersection / 87 homogeneous
  / 24 b-only → **inconsistent** (24 positions where `boundary ≠ 0`
  but `A = 0`).
- `identity` at L=3: union matching 4037 intersection / 7569
  homogeneous / 1857 b-only → **inconsistent** (1857 b-only positions).

## [2026-07-04] Configurable letter projection (--letter-projection)

### Summary
Replaced the hardcoded `colprojdiv_w1.wxf` divergent projection in
`--solve-collinear` (and in `compute_rhs`, which delegates to it) with a
required CLI flag `--letter-projection <file|identity>`. The flag is
**not optional** — every `--solve-collinear` and `compute_rhs`
invocation must pass it explicitly. The literal value `identity` skips
projection (solve in the full 11-dim letter space); any other value is
treated as a path to a projection matrix that is applied to each
11-dim letter slot via `apply_colprojdiv_slots`. This makes the
divergent-subspace projection user-selectable so the same solver can
target other letter subspaces without code changes.

### Modified
- **`bootstrap.cpp`** — added `letter_projection` field to `args_t`;
  `print_usage` now documents `--letter-projection <file|identity>`;
  added parsing and a required-validation that exits with code 1 and a
  helpful message if the flag is missing; the dispatch resolves
  relative paths against the executable directory and passes the value
  to `run_collinear_solver`.
- **`solve_collinear.hpp`** — `run_collinear_solver` now takes a
  `letter_projection` parameter (default `"identity"` for
  backward-compatible call sites). Step 5b is conditional: if the value
  is `"identity"`, prints a skip message and solves in the full letter
  space; otherwise loads the projection file (throws if not found) and
  applies it to both `A` and the boundary via `apply_colprojdiv_slots`.
  The indicator-vector verification step (Step 6) is skipped when
  `letter_projection == "identity"` because no divergent subspace is
  defined.
- **`compute_rhs.cpp`** — added `letter_projection` field to
  `rhs_args_t`; updated `print_usage`; added parsing and
  required-validation (exits 1 with help message if missing); relative
  paths resolve against the executable directory (matching
  `--data-dir` / `--output-dir`); passes the value to
  `compute_rhs_for_loop`.
- **`compute_rhs.hpp`** — `compute_rhs_for_loop` now takes a
  `letter_projection` parameter; the recursive call and the
  `./bootstrap --solve-collinear` subprocess invocation both pass it
  through. The subprocess receives an **absolute** path (resolved via
  `std::filesystem::absolute`) because the subprocess resolves relative
  paths against its own executable directory. Step 8 (indicator-vector
  verification) now branches: `identity` prints a skip message and
  loads `R_L` only for an nnz report; otherwise loads the projection
  matrix from `letter_projection` and runs the indicator-vector check
  as before.
- **`README.md`** — updated smoke-test examples and the CLI reference
  for both `bootstrap --solve-collinear` and `compute_rhs` to include
  `--letter-projection`; documented the flag in the options list and
  the multi-project threading convention.
- **`skills/04_collinear_solving.md`** — updated Purpose, CLI entry
  point, Flags table, Step 3 description, Step 6 (skipped if
  `identity`), Conventions (added required bullet), and Smoke test
  (all examples specify `--letter-projection`, plus an identity
  example).
- **`skills/05_compute_rhs.md`** — updated CLI entry point, Flags
  table, Step 4 (subprocess includes `--letter-projection`), Step 8
  (skipped if `identity`), Conventions, and Smoke test.

### Verified
- `./compute_rhs --target SEW_3p1 --letter-projection output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf`:
  L=2 succeeds, `R2` divergent-free (CRC32 `8f56256b`).
- `./compute_rhs --target SEW_5p1 --letter-projection output/collinear/colprojdiv_w1.wxf`:
  L=3 succeeds, `c[0] = -24, c[1] = 2`, `R3` divergent-free.
- `./compute_rhs --target SEW_3p1 --letter-projection identity`: L=2
  succeeded under intersection matching at the time of this entry.
  **Note:** this was superseded by the union-matching change later on
  2026-07-04 — `identity` is now inconsistent at all `L ≥ 2` for `E6`.
- Missing `--letter-projection` in either `compute_rhs` or
  `bootstrap --solve-collinear` → exits with code 1 and a helpful
  message showing example usage.

## [2026-07-04] --solve-collinear is now the complete collinear solver

### Summary
Moved the divergent-subspace projection (`apply_colprojdiv_slots`),
matching logic, and `solMHV_LL.wxf` writing from `compute_rhs` into
`solve_collinear.hpp::run_collinear_solver`. `compute_rhs` now delegates
the solve to `--solve-collinear` as a subprocess (like it already does
for `--extend` / `--sew` / `--project`), keeping only the boundary
(RHS) computation and the downstream `hepMHV` / `E_L` / `R_L`
derivation.

Previously `--solve-collinear` solved in the full 11-dim letter space
and failed at L≥3 because `E1` has divergent-letter entries. Now it
projects both `A` and the boundary to the 2-dim divergent subspace
before matching, producing consistent results at all loop orders.

### Modified
- **`solve_collinear.hpp`** — added `apply_colprojdiv_slots` (moved from
  `compute_rhs.hpp`); `run_collinear_solver` now loads `colprojdiv_w1`,
  projects `A` and the boundary to the divergent subspace, matches
  positions (preserving the sew axis), solves `c·A_match = b_match`, and
  writes `solMHV_LL.wxf` to `output/<L>loop/` for SEW targets.
- **`compute_rhs.hpp`** — removed `apply_colprojdiv_slots` (moved to
  `solve_collinear.hpp`); replaced the inline solve (steps 4–10:
  projection chain, expand `A`, divergent projection, matching, linear
  solve) with a `./bootstrap --solve-collinear` subprocess invocation;
  kept the boundary computation, `hepMHV` contraction, `E_L` expansion,
  `R_L` computation, and indicator-vector verification; loads
  `colprojdiv_w1` locally for the verification step.

### Verified
- `./bootstrap --solve-collinear --target SEW_5p1 --rhs output/3loop/boundary_3L.wxf --projection divergent`:
  unique solution `c[0] = -24, c[1] = 2`, 32 matching positions, writes
  `solMHV_3L.wxf` (CRC32 `fadd9cec`).
- `./compute_rhs --target SEW_3p1`: L=2 succeeds, `R2` divergent-free.
- `./compute_rhs --target SEW_5p1`: L=3 succeeds, `c[0] = -24, c[1] = 2`,
  `E3` (11606 nnz), `R3` (10461 nnz, divergent-free — only letters
  `{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}`).

## [2026-07-04] Multi-project path support (--data-dir / --output-dir)

### Summary
Threaded `--data-dir` / `--output-dir` through every pipeline mode so a
single checkout can serve multiple bootstrap projects (e.g. `E6`, `E7`,
`D5`) without editing source files. Each project lives in its own
`data_<PROJECT>/` + `output_<PROJECT>/` pair; the default (`data/` +
`output/`) remains backward compatible.

### Modified
- **`bootstrap.cpp`** — added `--data-dir` / `--output-dir` parsing and
  dispatch for `--project`, `--solve-symmetry`, `--solve-collinear`.
  Relative paths are resolved against the executable directory (same
  convention as `--condition` / `--first` / `--last` / `--output`).
  `--extend` / `--sew` ignore the flags (they use explicit `-c`/`-f`/`-l`/`-o`).
- **`projection.hpp`** — `run_projection_pipeline` signature changed from
  `base_path` to `data_dir` + `output_dir`; removed the internal
  `base / "data"` / `base / "output"` resolution.
- **`solve_symmetry.hpp`** — `run_symmetry_solver` signature changed from
  `base_path` to `data_dir` + `output_dir`; forwards both to
  `run_projection_pipeline`.
- **`compute_rhs.hpp`** — added `find_dlogmat(data_dir)` helper that scans
  for `dlogmat_*.wxf` instead of hardcoding `dlogmat_E6.wxf`; added a
  project-aware `run_bootstrap_cmd(cmd, data_dir, output_dir)` overload
  that appends `--data-dir <abs>` / `--output-dir <abs>` to every subprocess
  invocation so `--extend` / `--sew` / `--project` auto-invocations use the
  same project directories.
- **`compute_rhs.cpp`** — relative `--data-dir` / `--output-dir` now
  resolve against the executable directory (matching `bootstrap.cpp` and
  `inspect_tensors.cpp`); previously they were left relative to cwd.
- **`inspect_tensors.cpp`** — added `--output-dir` (and `--data-dir` for
  symmetry); `main` now takes `argc`/`argv` and resolves paths against the
  executable directory.
- **`run_workflow.sh`** — parameterized with `PROJECT` env var
  (`data_<PROJECT>/` + `output_<PROJECT>/`); auto-detects
  `dlogmat_*.wxf` in the data dir instead of hardcoding `dlogmat_E6.wxf`.
- **`run_projection.sh`**, **`run_solve.sh`** — parameterized with
  `PROJECT` env var; pass `--data-dir` / `--output-dir` to `bootstrap`.
- **`solve_collinear.hpp`** — fixed a misleading log message that printed
  `colprojdiv_SEW_SEW_3p1.wxf` (the actual file is `colprojdiv_SEW_3p1.wxf`
  because `sew_name` already includes the `SEW_` prefix).
- **`.gitignore`** — added `output_*/` to cover multi-project output dirs.
- **`README.md`** — removed the "Current limitation" caveat; documented
  the now-functional multi-project layout, the `PROJECT` env var, and the
  `--data-dir` / `--output-dir` flags for all three executables.

### Verified
- Default paths (`./compute_rhs --target SEW_3p1`): L=2 solve succeeds,
  `c[0] = 8`, all 8 constraints verified, `R2` divergent-free.
- Custom paths (`cp -r data data_test && ./compute_rhs --target SEW_3p1
  --data-dir data_test --output-dir output_test`): full pipeline runs
  end to end (subprocess `--extend` / `--sew` / `--project` all receive
  absolute `--data-dir` / `--output-dir`); produces byte-identical
  outputs (CRC32 match for `SEW_3p1_basis.wxf`, `E2.wxf`, `R2.wxf`,
  `boundary_2L.wxf`, `hepMHV_2L.wxf`).

## [2026-07-04] Standalone RHS computation module and divergent-subspace solve

### Added
- **`compute_rhs.cpp` / `compute_rhs.hpp`** — a standalone executable that
  recursively computes the collinear boundary (`E[L]`, `R[L]`, `boundary_LL`)
  from loop 2 up to a target SEW (e.g. `SEW_5p1` = 3-loop). Couples with
  the main `bootstrap` module to generate any missing SEW basis files.
  Exposes `--target`, `--data-dir`, `--output-dir` flags.
- **`tensor_shuffle.h`** — shuffle product implementation for the boundary
  formulas (`E1^n`, `E1·R2`, `E2^2`, etc.). Includes both sequential and
  parallel variants; the sequential variant is used for boundary
  computation because the parallel variant was observed to produce
  incorrect results for `E1^2/2`.
- **`inspect_tensors.cpp`** — a small diagnostic tool that prints the
  contents of `output/oneloop/E1.wxf` and `output/2loop/boundary_2L.wxf`
  for quick sanity checks.
- **`data/E1.wxf`** — the one-loop collinear seed tensor (renamed from the
  archive's `coloneloop.wxf`). Rank-2, `11 × 11`, 5 non-zero entries.
- **`data/DESCRIPTION.md`** — describes every seed file under `data/`.
- **`skills/`** — per-module skill documentation, structured for reuse by
  any AI agent (see `skills/README.md`).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** (this file).

### Modified
- **`Makefile`** — added build rules for `compute_rhs` and `inspect_tensors`
  (each depends on its own `.cpp` plus the shared headers).
- **`bootstrap.cpp`** — added `--project`, `--solve-symmetry`, and
  `--solve-collinear` modes dispatched to the new modules.
- **`solve_collinear.hpp`** — added the divergent-subspace projection step
  (`apply_colprojdiv_slots`) before matching `A` against the boundary, and
  rewrote the matching logic to preserve the sew axis in `A_match` (the
  prior `std::map<key,T>` overwrite dropped duplicate sew entries and broke
  the 2-unknown system at `L = 3`).
- **`linear_solve.hpp`** — adapted the linear solver to accept the
  sew-axis-preserving `A_match` / `b_match` tensors.
- **`tensor_expand.hpp`** — fixed the `expansion_perm` slot ordering so
  the new letter is placed immediately after the FEC axis (preserving the
  natural ascending weight order `[w1, w2, w3, w4]`); the prior code
  reversed the slot order to `[w1, w4, w3, w2]`.
- **`.gitignore`** — added `compute_rhs` and `inspect_tensors` to the
  ignored executables list.
- **`README.md`** — added a "Multi-Project Layout" section, per-module
  documentation, and updated the CLI reference.

### Verified
- L=2 (`SEW_3p1`): unique solution `c[0] = 8`, all 44 constraints
  satisfied; `R2` is divergent-free.
- L=3 (`SEW_5p1`): unique solution `c[0] = -24, c[1] = 2`, all 32
  constraints satisfied; `R3` contains only letters `{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}`
  (no divergent letters `{0,1}`), so `R3 = R*` is divergent-free as
  required by the collinear constraint.

## [2026-07-04] Collinear solver with projection chain, expansion, and linear solving

### Added
- **`solve_collinear.hpp`** — collinear solver implementing:
  - `colprojfin` and `colprojdiv` projection chain (FEC and SEW levels),
  - Tensor expansion by contracting with bases,
  - Non-homogeneous linear equation solving for `c·A = boundary`,
  - Indicator-vector verification that `R* = c·A - boundary` is
    divergent-free.
- **`linear_solve.hpp`** — generic sparse linear solver over `rat_t` using
  modular reconstruction (RREF over `Z / 2^61`, then reconstruct).
- **`tensor_expand.hpp`** — universal expansion function that contracts a
  tensor with a chain of bases (highest weight first).

### Modified
- **`Makefile`** — added the new headers to the `bootstrap` build rule.
- **`bootstrap.cpp`** — added the `--solve-collinear` mode, requiring
  `--target` and `--rhs` (exits with code 1 if `--rhs` is missing; `--rhs 0`
  means an empty RHS tensor).

## [2026-07-04] Symmetry solving module

### Added
- **`solve_symmetry.hpp`** — symmetry solver that computes the invariant
  subspace of a target's projection (cyclic, flip, parity). Writes
  `<target>_invariant.wxf` under `output/<symmetry>/`.

### Modified
- **`bootstrap.cpp`** — added the `--solve-symmetry` mode, requiring
  `--symmetry` and `--target`.

## [2026-07-04] Universal projection matrix module

### Added
- **`projection.hpp`** — universal projection pipeline supporting both
  collinear (dimension-shrinking) and symmetry (dimension-preserving)
  projections. Handles starting seeds (`colmat42`, `cycrepmat`, `flipmat`,
  `paritymat`) with `FEC_1`/`LEC_1` truncations. Stores the reduced basis
  for collinear projections (`first_w{N}_basis.wxf`,
  `last_w{N}_basis.wxf`, `SEW_{name}_basis.wxf`).
- **`run_projection.sh`** — driver script for the projection pipeline.
- **`run_solve.sh`** — driver script for the symmetry solver.

### Modified
- **`bootstrap.cpp`** — added the `--project` mode, requiring `--symmetry`
  and `--target`.
- **`run_workflow.sh`** — updated to use the new naming convention.

## [2026-07-04] CSR/COO consistency and projection logging

### Modified
- **`projection.hpp`** — all tensor functions now return CSR (matching the
  `bootstrap.cpp` and `bootstrap.hpp` convention); COO overloads removed.
- **`run_projection.sh`** — now uses `tee` to log to `logs/` and writes a
  `summary.txt` (with tensor dimensions, `nnz`, and CRC32) under each
  `output/<symmetry>/` directory.
- **`bootstrap.cpp`** — added CRC32 printing on every file read/write.

## [2026-07-04] Initial commit and macOS build setup

### Added
- Initial `bootstrap` executable with `--extend`, `--sew`, `--induce` modes.
- `bootstrap.hpp` — tensor layouts, forward/backward extension, sewing,
  timing, helper routines.
- `data/dlogmat_E6.wxf`, `data/FEC_1.wxf`, `data/LEC_1.wxf` — the `E6`
  seed tensors.
- `SparseRREF/` — included as a non-vendored dependency (clone separately).
- `README.md` — build and usage documentation.
- `.gitignore` — added `output/`, `logs/`, `temp/`, `tmp/`, `.trae/`,
  `.local/`, and the `bootstrap` executable.
- Updated `README.md` with macOS Homebrew GCC build instructions (the
  libc++ limitation on `std::execution::par` and `std::chrono::zoned_time`
  requires `g++-14`).
